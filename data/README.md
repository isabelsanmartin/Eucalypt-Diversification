Data used in the Diversification Rate analyses: "Fifty million years of eucalypt evolution and adaptation to climate"
1. Eucalypt timetree: "Eucalypts_2016_dated_r8s.tre". Maximum likelihood tree (ML1) of Thornhill et al. (2019), dated using 461 semiparametric penalized likelihood methods with secondary calibration points. The original phylogeny 731 species from tribe Eucalypteae and 17 outgroup taxa belonging to other tribes in the Myrtaceae family. This tree was pruned to remove the outgroups and the mesicalypt genera (Allosyncarpia, Eucalyptosis, Stockwellia, and Arillastrum), resulting in a phylogeny with 711 species (root node = 57.16 Myr), representing the “true” eucalypt genera, Angophora, Corymbia, and Eucalyptus. The original time tree included several soft polytomies, especially affecting the most recent phylogenetic relationships within subgenera Eucalyptus and Symphyomyrtus. We used the function multi2di in the R package ape to solve all multifurcating nodes by adding new internal edges of zero length; we also enforced the tree to be ultrametric (to solve numerical issues with rounding) using the function force.ultrametric (argument extend) in the R package phytools. The final timetree used in the analysis is "Eucalypts_2016_dated_r8s_ultrametric_binary_noOut_trueEuc.tre"
